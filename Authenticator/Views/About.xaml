                    Authenticator generates two-step verification codes on your computer without requiring a data connection.
                The application stores all the data locally and nothing is ever transmitted to our servers. In fact, we
                don't have any servers.

                    Authenticator is the resurrection of an old Windows app abandoned by its creators. We picked up the pieces
                and overhauled the user experience and code to release a quality app that the Windows Store deserves, and 
                desperately needs right now. We have released it as a free and open-source project and welcome pull requests
                and suggestions.
