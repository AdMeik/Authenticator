# Authenticator for Windows
This repository contains the official source code of the Authenticator for Windows app.
## Support
Since I was no longer maintaining this app, I have decided to make the app open source, so everyone would be able to clone, fork and compile his own version of Authenticator for Windows.
## Code quality
The codebase is, at the time of writing, already pretty old and could use some improvements. Still, it contains some useful pieces of code that I had to find out myself since there was not a lot to find on Google about UWP apps back then.

Be sure to grab pieces of code that you like and use them in your own app(s).
